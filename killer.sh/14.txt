You're ask to find out following information about the cluster k8s-c1-H:

How many controlplane nodes are available?
How many worker nodes are available?
What is the Service CIDR?
Which Networking (or CNI Plugin) is configured and where is its config file?
Which suffix will static pods have that run on cluster1-node1?
