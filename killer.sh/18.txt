 k get node
NAME                     STATUS     ROLES           AGE   VERSION
cluster3-controlplane1   Ready      control-plane   14d   v1.26.0
cluster3-node1           NotReady   <none>          14d   v1.26.0
First we check if the kubelet is running:


➜ ssh cluster3-node1

➜ root@cluster3-node1:~# ps aux | grep kubelet
root     29294  0.0  0.2  14856  1016 pts/0    S+   11:30   0:00 grep --color=auto kubelet
Nope, so we check if it's configured using systemd as service:


➜ root@cluster3-node1:~# service kubelet status
● kubelet.service - kubelet: The Kubernetes Node Agent
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
  Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
           └─10-kubeadm.conf
   Active: inactive (dead) since Sun 2019-12-08 11:30:06 UTC; 50min 52s ago
...


We see it's trying to execute /usr/local/bin/kubelet with some parameters defined in its service config file. A good way to find errors and get more logs is to run the command manually (usually also with its parameters).


➜ root@cluster3-node1:~# /usr/local/bin/kubelet
-bash: /usr/local/bin/kubelet: No such file or directory

➜ root@cluster3-node1:~# whereis kubelet
kubelet: /usr/bin/kubelet
Another way would be to see the extended logging of a service like using journalctl -u kubelet.

Well, there we have it, wrong path specified. Correct the path in file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf and run:


vim /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf # fix

systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart kubelet

systemctl status kubelet  # should now show running
Also the node should be available for the api server, give it a bit of time though:


➜ k get node
NAME                     STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
cluster3-controlplane1   Ready    control-plane   14d   v1.26.0
cluster3-node1           Ready    <none>          14d   v1.26.0
Finally we write the reason into the file:


# /opt/course/18/reason.txt
wrong path to kubelet binary specified in service config
